### What is Time Series Data
- Tracks change over time, records have timestamp and observations
- Stock price, CPU and memory usage, sensor data, ad views, covid-19
- Can be captured at regular intervals (metrics) or irregular intervals (events)
- Immutability, ordered, append-only (INSERTs)
- Events whose value increases when you ad time fixed (logins)
- Use cases: pattern recognition, forecasting (trends, seasonality), anomaly detection
